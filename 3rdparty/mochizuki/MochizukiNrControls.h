/* MochizukiNrRuntime.dll's own C exports, beside LmxxfNrGetApi (LmxxfNrApi.h, which this header leaves untouched, so
 * the lmxxf runtime and hosts that know only that ABI are unaffected). A host resolves each export with
 * GetProcAddress; a missing one means an older runtime.
 *
 * Versioning: every struct starts with struct_size, which the caller sets to the size of the struct it knows. A
 * reader uses a field only when struct_size >= offsetof(field) + sizeof(field), so a shorter struct (an older caller)
 * leaves the later fields at their defaults and a longer one (a newer caller) is accepted. Fields are only ever
 * appended, and no struct has implicit padding before its last field (explicit reserved fields fill any gap). A
 * function that fills a struct writes the whole fields that fit into the caller's struct_size, leaves anything past
 * them untouched (zero-initialise it) and sets struct_size to the end of the last field it wrote, never to its own
 * sizeof: tail padding (MochizukiNrInfo has 4 bytes after network_dispatches) is where the next field goes, so a
 * newer host must not take it for a field an older runtime wrote.
 *
 * LMXXF_NR_CREATE_FLAG_ZERO_OUTPUT_FALLBACK, for this runtime: when the network fails on a frame, the frame's
 * original colour is passed through to Super Resolution; the output is never zeros. */
